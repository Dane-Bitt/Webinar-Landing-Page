                <p class="textBody">A financial services expert with a specialization in guiding financial institutions and central banks around the world to develop and implement solutions to their specific challenges, Chris was unanimously confirmed by the US Senate to serve as the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Financial Institutions from 2017 to 2018. In that role, he was responsible for overseeing the Department’s efforts regarding financial institutions legislation and regulation, legislation affecting Federal agencies that regulate or insure financial institutions and securities markets legislation and regulation.

                    Chris oversaw the Deputy Assistant Secretaries for Financial Institutions Policy and Small Business, Community Development and Affordable Housing, and Cyber Security, in addition to a staff of 200. Prior to his role at the Treasury Department, Chris was the majority staff director in the U.S. Senate Committee on Finance.
                    
                    Chris speaks publicly about hardships he experienced while growing up below the poverty line. Rising from humble beginnings to the senior ranks of the US Treasury Department has imbued Chris with an enduring humility and a genuine understanding of Bitt’s transformative global vision for financial empowerment and inclusion.
                    
                    Campbell received an M.B.A. from Thunderbird School of Global Business Management and a Bachelor’s degree from the University of California, Santa Barbara in Political Science.
