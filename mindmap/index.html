The following charts represents a high-level framework from which to draw when preparing the formal considerations that are necessary for the implementation of a CBDC transactional network. Specific CBDC technology design considerations are divided into two main categories: the applications and the transaction network. With regards to application-specific considerations, different stakeholders such as the commercial bank &amp; PSP, regulators or Central Bank, will require various features as part of their applications, to meet their specific needs and mandate. Although technology solution providers can offer applications to all groups of stakeholders, other providers could also service stakeholders other than the regulator and the central bank. Another key consideration pertains to who has access to what information. Transaction network-specific considerations can further be divided into software and hardware. On the software side: The type of network deployment will define the stakeholders involved along with their respective roles. Whether centralized or decentralized, the CBDC transaction network will connect through an API, which will require consideration of multiple factors pertaining to access and connection to other networks. Management of the network, on the other end, will be influences by who develops the software, who hosts it, and who is responsible for maintaining it. On the hardware side: depending on who is the stakeholder type, owner/operator of the CBDC hardware infrastructure, various qualifications must be investigated. The owner/operator stakeholder type will further influence the hosting location of the CBDC transaction network, with repercussions across various spheres. The information provided in this chart is non-exhaustive and should be complemented with subject matter expertise and adjusted to take into consideration the specificities of each unique CBDC project.</p></div></div><div class="keyArea"><span class="mini-map-text">Cursor Keys:</span><li><img src="a0c62dc460146e6cf0eb.svg" width="28px" style="padding-right:10px"/> <span class="list-keys">scroll page</span></li><li><img src="8dd153c86b10fbeec762.svg" width="30px"/> <span class="list-keys">scroll / click to zoom-in</span></li><li><img src="a4899e9c7cc49041b8ea.svg" width="30px"/> <span class="list-keys">hover mini-map to zoom-in</span></li><li><img src="63880a2a308ef0cdb913.svg" width="30px" style="padding-left:10px"/> <span class="list-keys">click, hold & drap map to navigate</span></li></div></div><div class="mobile-container"><div class="mobile-scroll"><img id="angled" class="angled" src="9be60a56e937828ee8f6.svg" alt="WEF_CBDC_Technology"/></div></div><div class="container"><div id="myWindow"><img id="myContent" class="myContent" src="9be60a56e937828ee8f6.svg" alt="WEF_CBDC_Technology"/></div></div></div><div class="map-footer"><hr style="margin-top:30px;opacity:.3"/><h1 class="appendix-text" style="color:#00f;padding-top:30px">Appendix</h1><div class="row"><h2 style="padding:30px 0 0 10px">Bitt News</h2><div class="column"><img src="2b7dd0f3aa764b2c0b71.jpg" width="100%" height="800px"></div><div class="column"><h2 style="padding-top:0;margin:0">Bitts Value Proposition</h2><p>Bitt has tested and proven digital currency experience, which is already in circulation in several Eastern Caribbean countries.
